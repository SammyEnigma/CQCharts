+ create graph of connected nodes
+ place nodes
  + get max depth (src or dest)
  + create map of depth nodes (from depth or auto calc)
  + place src/dest edges for node
  + sort depth nodes by path id
  + calc max height of all depths (number of nodes and sum of sizes)
  + calc scale factors so nodes and margins will fit in bbox
  + place nodes per depth, top to bottom
  + adjust centers L->R and R->L
    + align determines with directions and whether first/last are adjusted or not
  + remove overlaps
    + remove overlapping nodes are each depth
  + reorder node edges to match y position (center)
