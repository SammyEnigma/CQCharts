  Column Type Mgr

Plots use Model Data and Selection Model
Model Data has one or more Selection Models
Table/Tree View has Selection Models for Model

#---

Model Data can be:
  + loaded
    + csv, tsv, json, gnu data, expression, tcl variable
  + grouped
  + processed
    + add column by expression
    + delete column
    + modify column
    + calc values
    + query values
    + analyze
  + sorted
  + filtered
    + expression
  + flattened
    + mean/sum of children
  + copied
  + exported
  + correlated
  + bucketed
    + bucketed column
  + folded
    + hier separator in column
    + bucketed column
  + subset
    + row/column range
  + transposed
  + summarized
    + random, sorted, paged
  + collapsed
    + mean/sum of children
  + pivoted
    + horizontal, vertical, data columns
  + stats
    + columns

#---

Grouping
  column
  bucket (auto/fixed real/integer range, auto/fixed string pattern)
  optimal number of buckets (for auto)

#---

Indices
  Plot model indices can be normalized or unnormalized.

  Normalized are mapped to source model  (non-proxy model)
  Unnormalized are mapped to proxy model (sort/filter model)

  Selection Indices are normalized (for safer compare ?)

#---

Model Data
  + base data is cell data
  + custom cell data by role (rarely used ?)
  + header data is data for whole column
  + header data by role allows custom value for whole column (min, max, sum, format, ...)

ToDo:
  + Import/export with full role data save/load
  + bad value per column
