Support:
  overlay : all plots same range
  x1x2    : common y range
  y1y2    : common x range
  tabbed  : single plot at a time

Composite plot directs all operations to current plot
 + never access non-current plot display data (ranges, zoom, ...)
 + uses common mouse over ... ?

Use virtuals to override behavior (re-direct to current plot)

TODO:
  viewBBox_ is always composite plot with tab adjust
